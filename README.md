# CSC_307_ToDoemon-

# Code Linter

In Taskemon, we will be implementing the Airbnb style guide:

- https://airbnb.io/javascript/react/

IDE Plugins that will be useful:

- ESLint
  - Simple install from Extensions if using VS Code
- Prettier - Code Formatter
  - Once installed from Extension, follow the instructions (for macOS):
    1. Code -> Settings -> Settings
    2. Check the 'Format On Save' option
    3. (Optional) If Step 2 doesn't work, might be due
       to conflicting formatters within your IDE. Another option
       that is possible in your settings is to set the Default
       Formatter to 'Prettier - Code Formatter'

# Navagation
npm install react-router react-icons

For the overwhelmed individual who needs extra motivation to get stuff done, the Taskemon is a productivity application that allows users to keep track of their daily tasks. Unlike Microsoft To Do, our product brings a gamified approach that allows users to feel rewarded for their completed tasks through virtual companions.
